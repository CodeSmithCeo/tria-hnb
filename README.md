# This project uses CRA start
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Altho there are IMHO now better alternatives available like the Vite + React start, Most people are still familiar with CRA start. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

**You will need to address CORS issues with a locally hosted app**, there are ways around to reconfigure browser to not care or use plugin.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**
